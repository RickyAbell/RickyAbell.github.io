          <br />

          <p>
          I started teaching myself to code in high school so I could build games and was immediately hooked. I went on to get my BSc and BSc Honours degrees in Computer Science and found a way to get university course credits for building <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/">Lego Mindstorm</a> robots that could play soccer.
          </p>
          <p>
          After graduating I joined <a href="http://www.derivco.com/">Derivco</a>. My largest project at Derivco was building HTML5 games for iOS and Android from scratch, way back in 2011, and is now one of the most successful products in the company. I was not only exposed to building front and back end solutions on a brand new platform but also helped scale a 3 person team to one of the largest departments in the company.
          </p>
          <p>
          At the end of 2014 I joined a brand new development team in South Africa to build software for SMART Technologies. I worked on real time services for <a href="http://education.smarttech.com/en/products/smart-amp">SMART Amp</a>, an education platform that enables students and teachers to collaborate and is used in classrooms around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of 2016 I started freelancing and worked on a number of projects for clients, ranging from full stack web development to native iOS development and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of 2016 I moved to London and joined <a href="https://import.io">import.io</a>. As a member of the platform engineering team I'm working on improving our
            back end services to make sure they can scale and meet the needs of our customers as well as adding new features to make it even easier to extract data from any website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the end of 2017 I joined <a href="https://www.rare.co.uk/">Rare</a> to work on <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/">Sea of Thieves</a>. We make use of <a href="https://coherent-labs.com/">Coherent</a> for Unreal Engine 4 to build game UI using web technologies.
